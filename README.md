# MyReads Project

An updated README that describes the project and has instructions for installing and launching the project is included.

The project contains two segments a bookshelf section that allows you to view and organize your books, and a search section, which allows you to view available books, and add them to your bookshelf.

## Bookshelf
The bookshelf allows you to view your books, move them between shelves (Read, Want To Read, Currently Reading).

From here, you'll be able to navigate from your bookshelf to the search view.

## Search View
From your search view, you'll be able to search for books (currently limited to the search terms in: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md)

You're also able to add books from to your bookshelf with the bookshelf selectors. These will also display the bookshelf that you currently have in your bookshelf.

You can navigate back to your bookshelf with the back arrow on the search bar.
